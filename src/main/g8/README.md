For REST calls with DDD/CQRS/ES only use GET and POST
GET for queries
  pagination and expand for large resources
 POST for commands
   "Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources" https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/
   A DDD command can be thought of as a subordinate resource to the DDD aggregate entity
   The command "could" have an identity and be queryable, for instance an async req/resp.
   A Saga needs to be implemented in this manner
   Command body should include a unique identifier, can be a span id
