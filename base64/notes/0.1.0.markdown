## Initial release

This is the first release of [base64](https://github.com/softprops/base64/#readme), a library for encoding raw data into its radix-64 representation.

This library was made with ‚ù§ in the spirit of [only doing one thing](https://github.com/softprops/base64/#why) without extra fanfare and doing it with [comparable performance](https://github.com/softprops/base64/#performance) to alternatives which all carry extra baggage.

Basic usage is as simple as 

     val payload = "Hadoop online... Caches warmed... Engage!"
     base64.Decode(base64.Encode(payload))
           .right.map(_.sameElements(payload))

For more engagement, see the project's [readme](https://github.com/softprops/base64/#readme)
